1. Data Minimization
# Videos are processed and immediately deleted
# Only anonymized gait features are stored
def process_and_delete_video(video_path):
    features = extract_gait_features(video_path)
    os.remove(video_path)  # Video deleted immediately
    return features

2. Anonymization:
# Participant IDs are generated, not personal identifiers
participant_id = f"P_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
# No names, addresses, or personal data stored

✅ Videos processed and deleted immediately
✅ Only anonymized numerical features stored
✅ No biometric data retention
✅ Minimal privacy risk
